    "I have utilized VAEs in my projects, and the way they reconstruct the image is incredible. AEs for image restoration involve training two encoders: one for real and synthetically degraded images, and another for clean images. The encoders compress images into a shared latent space and a separate clean space, respectively. The network then learns a mapping between these spaces using synthetic image pairs, allowing it to \"translate\" the latent representation of a degraded image towards the clean space. Finally, a decoder utilizes this translated representation to reconstruct a restored image, aiming to be closer to the original.\n",
